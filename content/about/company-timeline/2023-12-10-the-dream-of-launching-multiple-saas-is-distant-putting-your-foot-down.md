Our purpose with cljam was to be a MicroSaaS launch company, starting with the launch of moclojer, but we were being extremely optimistic that launching SaaS of Open Source software that we maintain would be "simple", we made a mistake and decided to put our efforts into moclojer as the main product.

As of today, cljam will be at a standstill, and we will put 100% of our efforts into developing the **moclojer cloud** product *(the SaaS version of [moclojer foss](https://github.com/moclojer/moclojer))*.

We're happy to share our "mistake" (or reckless decision making), I'd say we were innocent in thinking we'd be able to embrace the world so quickly.

> it's important to enjoy the journey and learn from our mistakes

### Will cljam be active again?

I won't say no, but today our main objective is the **moclojer**, to do a good job of building the product and launching it, we have a lot to learn from the first product before thinking about the next ones.
