The company began with the name **cljazz**, inspired by the musical style **Jazz üé∑**.

We are a company that aims to develop small open source products, provide them as a service (SaaS, i.e. MicroSaaS) and all the software we develop will use the Clojure programming language.

Clojure uses `.clj` for its file names, and in an attempt to combine the **Jazz üé∑** musical style with Clojure, the old name cljazz was coined.

Looking at the purpose of the company, which by ‚Äúdefault‚Äù needs to have a highly creative and collaborative environment and not escape from the ‚Äúmusical world‚Äù, we decided to look for a name that, when read, refers to this environment of creativity.

> **note:** A **Jam** Session is a relatively informal musical event, process, or activity where musicians, typically instrumentalists, play improvised solos and vamp over tunes, drones, songs, and chord progressions. Original jam sessions, also called *‚Äúfree flow sessions‚Äù*, are often used by musicians to develop new material (music) and find suitable arrangements, read more here.
