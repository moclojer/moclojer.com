We're about to launch the moclojer cloud, and we're finishing up the final adjustments to our service structure *(**event-driven** microservices)*:

* monitoring queues to identify faults and collect service metrics
* improving the UX (user experience), making the interface as intuitive as possible
* identifying communication bottlenecks between services
* running security tests
* ... in short, we're almost there

I'm sure we're looking forward to this launch more than you are.

After the launch, we'll write about the architecture of our services. It'll be nice to share with everyone what we're doing privately to serve moclojer foss as a service.
