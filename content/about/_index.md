We are an open source organization that was born with the goal of contributing to the Clojure/Script ecosystem by creating a toolkit to simplify the development of Terminal User Interface (TUI) solutions in Clojure and other tools that enhance the Clojure development experience.

Our business model is based on providing hosted versions of our open source projects as SaaS solutions, while maintaining our commitment to the open source community.

## Our Mission

We develop products with "clojure by design" principles, focusing on:

- **Simplicity**: Creating tools that are easy to use and understand
- **Efficiency**: Building high-performance solutions with minimal overhead
- **Developer Experience**: Prioritizing a smooth and enjoyable development experience
- **Open Source**: Sharing our work with the community under permissive licenses

## Our Values

Fuel that feeds our **culture**!

### Radical transparency

There is no reason to be secretive about our data, from the data generated by our products to our employees' salaries.

We follow a model called [Open Startup](https://hackernoon.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-open-startup-f4446984189) — we super understand if you can't discuss complicated subjects in public (e.g., the amount of your salary), if that's your profile, **unfortunately moclojer is not the company for you**.

### Customer experience

Usually, customers are right, our solutions should be developed with the customer's use in mind, in the Open Source version and especially in the SaaS version—our customer will probably not be technical and our UI/UX should take the customer where they need to go.

### Product engineering

We call engineers product engineers, meaning that we deliver better software by understanding the customer's needs and using the products we develop *(empathy with the customer's "pain")*.

### Clojure by design

Whatever we develop, it will be developed using **Clojure**. This does not restrict us from using/contributing services, software, etc. written in another programming language, but our software will be written in *Clojure*.

## Join Our Community
