# About

We are a customer-focused company using open source and we use clojure by design to develop our solutions. Our business model is SaaS, providing a version of the Open Source moclojer hosted on our infrastructure.

The moclojer supports API-first development with the API Builder. You can design your API directly with moclojer using the `yaml`, `edn`, and `OpenAPI 3` specification. Your specification can then act as the only source of truth for your API design, and you can use it to generate documentation, mock servers, and client SDKs.

## **Our way of looking at the economy is open and decentralized, what do we mean by that?**

We deal openly with money, from our team's remuneration to the company's turnover. We are transparent about our costs and our income. We are decentralized in the sense that we are not tied to a specific location, we are a remote-first company.

In order to improve our product, we will help the Clojure ecosystem by opening up the solutions we develop internally to the Open Source (Clojure) community as much as possible. We will also contribute to the community by participating in the development of various libraries and the clojure ecosystem.
