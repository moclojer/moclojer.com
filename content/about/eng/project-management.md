*💡 Never wait until you have an extremely well-defined task to get started. If you believe that the idea will work, take responsibility for it and help us define it.*

We work with **responsible adults**, which means that we take responsibility for making things happen with the other members of the team, **we don't have a superhero in the team but a team that will make things happen.**

A task is not a request for “*pastry”* where everything is defined, and you're going to pull it out *"just to program"*, encouraging engineers to be **product engineers** *([Careers](/about/careers/))*, not just programming for programming. We need to understand what will get the company closer to its goal faster *([moclojer](/about/))*, and at many times take the risk that the initiative will work *(that's why it's critical to have data before we start, so we can minimize our risk — minimize, not cure, we'll always buy a dose of risk)*.

**If you don't have data** to give us visibility of the path to follow *(risk)*, it's better to take a step back and collect data and only then assess whether it makes sense or not.

> task control is done on **GitHub**, using [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) and [projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects).
