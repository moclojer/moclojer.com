The [moclojer](https://github.com/moclojer/moclojer) is an Open Source product. To serve it as a service, we created an event-based architecture for event propagation and data processing, generating triggers for specific actions.

## Backend Services

The following are the services and integrations that keep moclojer's backend alive:

* **back/api**: acts primarily as an API gateway for all client interactions, handling requests and routing them to appropriate services through message queues. Encapsulates initial business logic for user mocks, propagating necessary events to other services;
* **yaml/generator**: is responsible for updating every mock, as a processed and validated raw file, for any event, may it be creation, deletion, update, etc. It also manages a main raw mock file, which we call the `unified mock`, where all user mocks are aggregated, in order to be used in `moclojer/foss`'s runtime. The generated raw files are stored in our `object-store`;
* **cloud/ops**: manages and monitors our infrastructure, user mock domains and DNS records, by applying a facade on our two current used cloud solutions, namely DigitalOcean and CloudFlare;
* **[moclojer/foss](https://github.com/moclojer/moclojer)**: the open source version of moclojer, extended as a framework within an isolated service. Based on the content of the `unified mock` given from consequent events from `yaml/generator`, serves unique mock endpoints, acting therefore as the final API.

## Web Frontend

We currently serve a web interface for user interactions.

* **Stack**: ClojureScript, [Helix](https://github.com/lilactown/helix), [Refx](https://github.com/ferdinand-beyer/refx), TailwindCSS.

## Data Layer

* **Postgres**: We use Postgres as our main database.
* **Redis**: since moclojer is event-driven, we use Redis as a message broker, through its Pub/Sub mechanism.

## Communication and Integration

* **[p001/proxy](https://github.com/moclojer/p001):** a reverse proxy for our internal services that accesses outsider APIs;

## Infrastructure

We use [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/70c384d0d807) as our infrastructure provider, our goal is to serve moclojer foss in a scalable way for all users. To achieve this, we use the [App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/) to serve applications, [Managed Database](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases) to provide managed databases (PostgreSQL and Redis), and [Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/) to serve the reverse proxy and [Supabase](https://supabase.com/auth) for frontend authentication.

Application logs are sent to [Logtail](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/add-ons/logtail), installed via [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/70c384d0d807) add-ons.

### App Platform

The [App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, deploy, and scale applications quickly and easily. It supports several programming languages, including Clojure ðŸ’œ, and provides a range of features to help developers build and deploy applications more efficiently.

We have two applications on the App Platform:

**moclojer-app**

* `static_sites` serving the **frontend**, with `ingress` *(public access)*
* `services` serving the **back/api**, with `ingress` *(public access)*
* `workers` running the **yaml/generator** and **cloud/ops**
* `databases` running the **postgres** and **redis/mq** managed

**moclojer-foss**

* `services` serving the **moclojer/foss**, with `ingress` *(public access)* - with support for multiple domains

> We use managed infrastructure to focus our efforts on the product we serve as a service, not on the infrastructure that supports it. [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/70c384d0d807) helps us stay focused on what really matters.

### Infrastructure & Overall Architecture

This is a simplified overview of how our described services connect and interact between themselves after built, deployed and running on Digital Ocean.
