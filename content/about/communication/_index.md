# Communication

> this page could be called "how we communicate", but it sounded too much like the Globo Reporte program with "where they live, what they eat, ..." KKKKKKJKKK

We are a **distributed** company ~~(we don't work from home)~~, we work with **responsible adults** who are committed to what we do and who all see the impact that the products we develop have.

We communicate asynchronously **via text**, giving people the freedom to work at the time they think is most productive.

To complete this, we share where we plan to go, the problem we need to solve and give them as much autonomy as possible to help us get there.
