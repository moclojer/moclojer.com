# Threads: writing in such a way that people understand us

> we need to write text that makes people understand what we mean, communication is what people understand, not "just" what we say

I _([@avelino](https://github.com/avelino))_ admit that writing isn't easy, even though we've known how to write for many years (we learned it at the base of our education), but even though we've known how to write for many years, we've practiced our writing skills very little.

When I write a thread (text) I have as a premise that the person who will read it doesn't know anything about what I know. This helps us to get out of our heads the things that we think are obvious to everyone and turn what is obvious to me into a text that everyone can understand.
