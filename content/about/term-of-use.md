## Acceptance of the Terms of Use

By using our SaaS (Software as a Service) solution, you automatically accept our **Terms of Use**. Please read them carefully below.

## 2. Services

We provide a SaaS version of **[moclojer](https://github.com/moclojer/moclojer)** open source (open source "api mock" solution) for proprietary, development or commercial use.

## Use of mocks (created with moclojer cloud)

The API mocks generated with moclojer cloud will be active as long as they receive updates.

**Automatic deactivation of mocks:** if the mock does not receive any type of request within 24 hours, it will be automatically deactivated - valid for the "free" plan.

**Mock reactivation:** the deactivated mock can be reactivated manually via the dashboard.

## 4. User Responsibilities

The user is entirely responsible for the proper use of the SaaS solution and for the consequences resulting from improper use. The moclojer company shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or special damages or losses of any nature whatsoever resulting from the improper use and data contained in the moclojer cloud mocks.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall we be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or special damages or losses of any kind resulting from the use of moclojer cloud.

## 6. Changes to the Terms of Use

We reserve the right to change these Terms of Use at any time. If we make changes, we will inform you by posting the latest version of the Terms of Use in our changelog.

## 7. Contact

If you have any questions about these Terms of Use, please contact us via our support channel _(`support AT moclojer DOT com`)_.
